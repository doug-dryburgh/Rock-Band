            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Rock Band is probably the greatest band you've never heard of. Well it's time to get educated!</p>
            <p>It's four members: Mike Smith, Bob Smith, Joe Smith and Frank Smith are all surprisingly not related. They are four best friends who met behind a Denny's downtown. They quickly realized they all have an intense passion for music and decided to form the most epic band in the world.</p>
            <p>This didn't happen overnight though. Things did not get off to a great start: problems with jealous controlling girlfriends ran rampant. Mike's continuing battle with addiction, [video games], was the elephant in the room.</p>
            <p>June 29, 1987 would be a date that would change the world. That was the day Rock Band entered the East Surrey Community Centre's battle of the bands. It's safe to say that the 12 people in attendance were sufficiently rocked to tell their friends, and them their friends. Word spread like wildfire. Finally after years of collective shame about Nickleback Canadians had a band to be proud of.</p>
            <p>Today Rock Band is the most saught after band in the world. They regularly sell out major stadiums around the world. After years of struggle Mike has found sobriety. To date it's been 18 months since he last logged into World of Warcraft. In his spare time he now travels to different schools to give inspirational talks about the lure and dangers of MMORPG video games.</p>
